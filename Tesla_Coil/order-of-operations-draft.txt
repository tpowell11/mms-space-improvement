- solder in u1, u2, u3 sockets
- do all 0.1u ceramics (c1-c8)
- next do r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 (ucc37322 done)
- get d1 and c9 (by 555) (555 done)
- do c10 and trimpot by cd74 (cd74 done)
- do TVS1, TVS2, TVS3
- do q1 then c11 (fet done)
- do terminal blocks (need to show The Technique)
- do d2, d3, and fuse
- u4, u5,
- c12, c13, c14
- tr1
- led1


(if anybody foregoes direct instructions and just tries to solder the components in we have a checklist for them. in fact, everybody has a checklist they need to do at the end.)

checklist:
1. C14 is in the correct orientation
2. c12 is correct
3. d2
4. d3
5. d1
6. u5 and u4
7. d1
8. r1, r2, r3, r4 arent swapped
9. no bridges please
10. all DIP ICs placed correctly



Soldering review
-make sure air is turned on
-typical safety warnings
    -use glasses
    -please treat the iron as if it is hot no matter what
    -after soldering, components may be hot
    -try not to breathe the fumes
-to solder, first insert components and bend their leads to keep them in place
    -for components with many pins, you may only need to bend a corner or two
    -generally its best to start with small components and do big ones later so you have more space. We've done this here
    -once youve put in components, you can start soldering
        -place the iron against a lead and the copper around it, and begin heating both up
            -it depends on the component, but after a second or two, usually it will be hot enough for you to add solder
            -make sure there's a decent amount, let it flow for a second, then take the iron away
            -[images] here is a good joint, here is a cold joint. please avoid case 2
            -[images] here is a bridge. usually these are difficult to do accidentally but definitely avoid
            -if you're unsure about how to do something, just ask. i know everything
        -if your solder starts acting chunky, you may need some flux. we have it up here
    -once your component is soldered in, you can trim the leads with some flush cutters
